<h1>Learnable Programming: Notes on Bret's Paper</h1>
<p>I just finished reading Bret Victor’s Learnable Programming. Bret’s writings are extremely thoughtful. Everyone should read them. I cant help but be awed by the amount of empathy Bret shows. Empathy is extremely subtle, and difficult.  It’s the foundation of great teaching and writing.   I was fortunate that the first programming book I ever learned from, Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs, was from pair of great teachers – Hal Abelsson and Gerald J. Sussman.</p>
<p>Here is how the SICP begins...<p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it is in any synthetic, creative activity. In becoming an expert photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible choice of exposure and development conditions. Only then can one reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and development to obtain the desired effects. So it is with programming, where we are planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where we control the process by means of a program. To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior”</span>
<p><b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" - Abelson & Sussman</b></p>

<p>Bret thinks we should do more. The following are snippets I enjoyed. Please go read the entire <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">article</a> because the interactive examples are what make this article great.</p>

<p>“People understand things that they can see and touch. In order for a learner to understand what the program is actually doing, the program flow must be made visible and tangible.”</p>
<p>“What matters is the underlying purpose: enabling the learner to follow the program flow, by controlling time and seeing patterns across time.”</p>
<p>“We expect programmers to write code that manipulates variables, without ever seeing the values of those variables. <b>We expect readers to understand code that manipulates variables, without ever seeing the values of the variables. The entire purpose of code is to manipulate data, and we never see the data.</b> We write with blindfolds, and we read by playing pretend with data-phantoms in our imaginations.”</p>
<p>“If you are serious about creating a programming environment for learning, the number one thing you can do -- more important than live coding or adjustable constants, more important than narrated lessons or discussion forums, more important than badges or points or ultra-points or anything else -- is to show the data.”</p>
<p>“All state must be eliminated or shown. Either can be a reasonable design decision. An environment that does neither -- forcing learners to imagine the state and make sense of functions that produce no visible effect -- is irresponsible design, and disrespectful to the learner.”</p>
<p>“Code manipulates data. To understand code, a learner must see the data, and see the effect of code on the data”</p>
<p>“The create-by-reacting way of thinking could be stated as: start with something, then adjust until it's right.”</p>
<p>“The programmer must be able to do her thinking out in the environment, not trapped in her head. The environment must serve as an external imagination, where the programmer can be continuously reacting to a work-in-progress.”</p>
<p>“To be clear, this does not relieve the programmer from thinking! It simply makes those thoughts immediately visible. I am happy to be composing this essay in a text editor, where my words become visible and editable as soon as I think of them, as opposed to working entirely internally like the orators and playwrights of the distant past."</p>
<p>"Start concrete, start grounded. Start with one specific case, entirely understood. Then gradually generalize, level by level, in such a way that the programmer still fully understands the program at each level of abstraction.... <b>The learner always gets the experience of interactively controlling the lower-level details, understanding them, developing trust in them, before handing off that control to an abstraction and moving to a higher level of control."</b></p>
<p>"Modularity is the human mind's lever against complexity. Breaking down a complex thing into understandable chunks is essential for understanding, perhaps the essence of understanding."</p>
<p>"A programming language must encourage the programmer to decompose -- to approach a complex problem by breaking it into simpler problems. Papert refers to this as breaking down a program into "mind-size bites"."</p>
